Hello!
In this era, coding has became a holy grail for people.
So, I encourage you to kep on coding!
Learn something new!
Try something out!
And do not be afraid to make mistakes.
Even I, a website developer, failed may times, especially in JS/HTML.
But, I kept on going, and now I have 13 websites up!
Thank you.
