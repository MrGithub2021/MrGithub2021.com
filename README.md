# Motivation
Hello!

In this era, coding has became a holy grail for people.

So, I encourage you to kep on coding!

Learn something new!

Try something out!

And do not be afraid to make mistakes.

Even I, a website developer, failed many times, especially in JS/HTML.

But, I kept on going, and now I have more than 13 websites up!

Thank you very much and keep on coding!.
